# Signal Generator

Electronic circuits may need a signal of known amplitude, frequency and waveform (sinus, sawtooth, square...) during the engineering stage. 
This python scripts uses the audio card of a computer to generate such signal.

The signal is saved as a short wave file readable by any player. The player is then set to loop and the signal recovered from the output of the audio card.
No exotic module needed; the modules come with the default Anaconda install.

Below is the picture of an oscilloscope screen, reading a sinusoid generated by the python script and rendered by a computer's audio card.
